# Basic Template

A most basic generic template with default documentation

## Why

Even in an internal project, documentation is important so that colleagues are able to easily identify what a repository is for and contribute to the project while keeping to the original vision and scope.

See Github's documentation on innersourcing [here](https://resources.github.com/innersource/fundamentals/)

## Files

### README.md

A summary of what the repo contains

* describe the purpose of the project
* illustrate what it does or how to use it
* list dependencies or prerequisites

### CONTRIBUTING.md 

Contributing guidelines

* conventions the project follows
* how to report bugs or request features, what details should be provided
* how to find issues to work on
* where to submit a pull request

[Here](https://github.com/nayafia/contributing-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-template.md) is an example pulled together from some good opensource projects

### CODEOWNERS 

Use this to require approvers for certain files

### PR and issue templates to help contributors comply with guidelines

How to create [issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/manually-creating-a-single-issue-template-for-your-repository) and [pull request templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)

Gives a template that contributors can fill out to ensure they include steps to reproduce, reasoning, or other details as necessary

### SECURITY.md

Describes the security policy

Provide instructions on how to report security vulnerabilities - Github provides functionality to allow them to be reported privately so that you can be given details about the exploit without the information becoming publicly known

### LICENSE.md

See Github documentation on opensource licenses: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository
